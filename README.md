# qrcode-svg
## What It Is
Stripped-down version of the code by [papnkukn](https://github.com/papnkukn/qrcode-svg). 

I am removing the nodeJs functionality and making this simply a resource for generating SVG QR codes. 

I also plan to make some changes to papnkukn's code to suit my own desired functionality and understanding.
