# qrcode-svg

## USE THE [ORIGINAL](https://github.com/papnkukn/qrcode-svg) IF YOU WANT THE Node.jsÂ® VERSION
___
## What It Is
Stripped-down version of the code by [papnkukn](https://github.com/papnkukn/qrcode-svg). 

I am removing the Node.js functionality and making this simply a resource for generating SVG QR codes. 

I also plan to make some changes to papnkukn's code to suit my own desired functionality and understanding.
___
## Need To Do
### In the parameters object for instanciating `new QRCode()`
- option to generate png instead of svg
- `container: 'svg'` seems to be the only valid option right now, despite other options specified by papnkukn. This must have broken in my edits.
